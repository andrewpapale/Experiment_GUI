# Experiment_GUI
### Contributors: Andrew Papale, Taylor Kveragas

##### Experiment_GUI is a Matlab program that tracks mice in real time while they perform navigational tasks.
### **Goals:**
* *Organize & Clean up code*
* Minimize the nose-tail flipping problem
* Minimize false positive body positions detected sometimes
* Figure out how to eliminate the delay when Matlab plots every 10 frames in real-time
* Figure out why sometimes the video files donâ€™t save
* Get the program working for mice with black fur (possibly only when lights are on?).
* Optimize the program for speed (might want to consult with a Comp Sci professor for this step)
* Test the program on different tasks, in different rooms (likely through a collaboration), with different computers and cameras.  Possibly test with rats?
* Report a positive optogenetic feedback result (e.g. finding fake spots) based on position or sniffing data (with StretchSense sensor).
